# 0.5.8

11.1.7 toc update

# 0.5.7

11.1.5 toc update & addon category


# 0.5.6

Temporarily remove option to fade the speedometer as it causes conflicts with the drive system frame. The speedometer will now always fade when dismounted / landing after dragonriding as it was originally designed to.

# 0.5.5

Make frame hide when dismounting from drive vehicle if the option to fade frame isn't chosen

# 0.5.4

Added data for Undermine races to the journal.

# 0.4.8

Clean up library files

# 0.4.7

Removed minimap button

# 0.4.6

Vigor model fix, Minimap button, Open talents button, (maybe) fix to map pin click in journal (this one is a bit of an anomaly, for some reason it just doesn't set until reload but it's hard to reproduce)

# 0.4.5

Fix to Storm's Watch Survey Reverse gold time, reworked how Charge/Model frames are attached to the vigor bar

 - if you have an addon that rescales the widget manager (encounter bar), particularly in different conditions during dragonriding and solely for the vigor bar, it probably will misalign either the charges/models. i'm not fixing this, an addon shouldn't be doing it like that. Tell Blizzard to add options to scale the encounter bar or overhaul widgets instead or something.

# 0.4.4

maybe potentially fixed widget being persistent especially after entering a BG who knows the NA realms went down before i could test it so good luck

# 0.4.3

(Maybe) fixed issue where the vigor bar would move kinda sometimes at "random" (reproducable with the emerald dream portal).

 - this was caused by a function that intended to fix some older blizz bugs where the vigor bar stayed persistent.
 - if the double vigor bar bug happens again, it's because i removed this function, but idk how to reproduce that bug.
 - the function would hide the secondary vigor bar and force the widgets to update, clearing out widgets to produce the proper one.

# 0.4.2

German translations thanks to Cirez (this was actually added in 0.4.1 but I forgot to add it until literally right after pushing the update)

Added global accessible `DRStatusBar` for the speedometer frame for other addons to access.

Hopefully maybe fixed taint issue that occurred when opening edit mode?
