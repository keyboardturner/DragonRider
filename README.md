# DragonRider
Displays speed values above the vigor bar and maybe does some other stuff.

<p>This project aims to bring more information to help maximize dragonriding vigor usage and speed without being burdensome and still matching the general game style.</p>
<p>Currently this addon includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A spedometer capable of telling speed in yd/s</li>
<li>Status bar built in to spedometer that changes color depending on if you're actively gaining vigor or above terminal velocity</li>
<li>animated Vigor orbs when the bar is filled</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the planned features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detection notification for nearby dragon glyphs</li>
<li>Cooldown timers for each major spell</li>
<li>More custom art &amp; options to customize the UI</li>
<li>Dragon race statistics tracker (and maybe sharing with other players?)</li>
<li>Dragon race notification tracker (for multiplayer races and so on)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project is fairly early in conception. It may take some time to fully flesh out these features - the goal will be to have some of the more basic features implemented for the Kalimdor / Eastern Kingdoms Cups, and to help with the future challenging races.</p>
